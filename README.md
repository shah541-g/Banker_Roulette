# Banker_Roulette
This is my first python Project. I have started practicing it by practical applications. 
Banker Roulette is social or informal game often played among a group of people, typically 
in a restaurant or bar setting, where the goal is to decide who pays the bill.

If you're going to run this code, here are some points which you have to keep in mind 
before running this:

> **How the code actually working**
1) we are using 2 main modules in this code, (random and time)
2) From time modeule we are getting current second for seeding in random
3) random module is used to select any random person from withing the names you've provided

> **How to run the code**
1) You have to provide names of your friends comma seperated
2) All kind of starting and ending whitespaces are removed from the input, so there is no
   problem if you provide an input like  (ahmad,  ). remember brackets are put here just for
   the purpose of readability, don't provide brackets in input.
